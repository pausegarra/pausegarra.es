![Survey Monkey Webhook Manager](/smwm.png)

Survey Monkey Webhook Manager is a full-stack web application designed to provide complete control over the management of SurveyMonkey webhooks. It enables authenticated users to perform full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on webhook configurations while ensuring secure access, reliability, and a modern development experience. This tool is particularly useful for teams and developers who work with SurveyMonkey’s API and need a centralized, user-friendly interface to manage webhook endpoints across multiple forms or surveys.

At its core, the application integrates tightly with the SurveyMonkey API, allowing users to link their accounts, retrieve available resources, and configure webhooks for specific events such as survey responses or collector updates. It exposes an intuitive dashboard where each webhook can be registered with precise control over event types, callback URLs, and associated metadata.

The backend is built using Node.js, leveraging modern tooling and middleware for secure token-based authentication, robust API handling, and persistent data storage. Authentication is enforced to protect webhook configuration access, ensuring only authorized users can view or modify resources. The use of Next.js on the frontend provides a fast, responsive, and server-side rendered interface that enhances both SEO and performance.

The entire system is designed to be containerized and easily deployable via Docker, enabling quick setup in any environment—local, staging, or production. Webhook payloads can be inspected in real-time, with optional logging or custom logic injection points for debugging or processing.

Key use cases include:
* Managing multiple webhook endpoints across different SurveyMonkey accounts or surveys.
* Providing secure access control for teams who need to collaborate on webhook management.
* Enabling a plug-and-play experience for developers to test or deploy SurveyMonkey webhooks in seconds.

Whether you’re building a platform that needs to react to live survey data, or you’re simply looking to simplify how you register and test SurveyMonkey events, this project offers a modern, secure, and extensible solution for handling everything webhook-related.
