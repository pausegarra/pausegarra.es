Your personal companion to mastering the Russian language.

This cheatsheet is a comprehensive tool designed to support learners in their journey to master the Russian language. It covers fundamental aspects of the language including the alphabet, vocabulary, grammatical cases, and verb conjugations.

The project includes an explanation of the Russian alphabet to help users become familiar with Cyrillic characters and their pronunciation. It provides a searchable vocabulary list that supports queries in English, Spanish, and Russian, aiding multilingual users. It also offers tools to explore the conjugation patterns of Russian verbs, including aspectual pairs and irregular forms. Furthermore, it explains how nouns and adjectives change according to grammatical cases. A dedicated section discusses motion verbs, one of the more complex yet essential parts of Russian grammar.

Additionally, the project features an administrative interface where authenticated users can add, edit, and manage vocabulary entries and their grammatical metadata. The RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system is managed via Keycloak to ensure secure access control.

Built using Java with Quarkus for the backend, ReactJS for the frontend, and PostgreSQL for data storage, the system is containerized with Docker and secured with authentication layers for robust deployment.
